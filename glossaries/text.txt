200000202013||to learn more about Reborn.
200000202111||Rest here, tarnished.

200000720111||Push the block button when attacked to perform a deflect.
200000720112||Time it well to trigger the effect; negates all physical damage
200000720113||and 75% elemental damage. Depending on timing, you will
200000720114||lose a portion of stamina, better timing = less stamina lost.
200000720115||The attacker will take posture damage on deflect.
200000720211||Light load = nimble, but short dashes, short i-frame windows
200000720212||Medium load = less nimble long range rolls, medium i-frame windows
200000720213||Heavy rolls = Slower rolls, short range, short window.
200000720221||Each equip load type also has a unique back step animation.
200000720311||Weapons have no requirements. Instead, damage is majorly
200000720312||based on the scaling of your weapon's associated stats.
200000720313||(Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Dexterity & Arcane)
200000720314||If you do not level the associated scaling stats of a weapon, 
200000720315||it will not be particularly viable; even at max upgrade.
200000720411||Spells do not have requirements.
200000720412||Spell damage depends on the catalysts "spell power."
200000720413||Spell power is increased via the associated catalyst's scaling.
200000720414||All catalysts have varying abilities and special effects.
200000720511||Reinforce weapons here
200000720611||Perform guard counters in tandem with deflects
200000720612||to maximize posture damage potential.
200000720621||To guard counter, initiate a heavy attack 
200000720622||immediately after deflecting.
201244103111||Weapon leveling and scaling has received a large rework in Reborn. 
201244103112||Long story short; invest in your primary scaling stats (Str, Dex, Int, Fth) how you would normally.
201244103113||Upgrading will give large boosts to scaling. 
201244103211||Equip load rework:
201244103221||Light load provides a hybrid of blood borne and sekiro animations. Short i-frame windows, short dodge delays.
201244103222||Medium load provides what is essentially light load rolls. 
201244103223||Heavy rolls are mostly the same, but with new animations that allow it to be somewhat viable.
201244103311||Push the block button when attacked to perform a perfect block/deflect.
201244103321||The deflect will negate all physical damage, 75% of elemental damage, 
201244103322||75% of stamina damage and will also deal posture damage to the attacker.

20600000000111||Blocking at the exact moment of an enemy attack, will trigger a deflect.
20600000000112||Performing a deflect will negate all physical damage, and deal slight posture damage to the attacker.
20600000000211||Spells in Reborn have wildly varying charged versions. 
20600000000212||Be sure to Try them all.
20600000000311||In Reborn, there is no more fat roll for Highest weight capacity tier.

20600000000511||Bows and arrows, have seen vast reworks.
20600000000512||Bow builds are viable and vast.
20600000000513||Be sure to experiment and explore thoroughly to get the most out of it.

20600000000612||Catalysts passively regenerate 1.5% fp per second.
20600000000613||The more you invest in FP (mind) the more FP your catalyst will regenerate fp per second.
20600000000711||For Reborn, the regeneration speed for poise has been significantly lowered to 2 points per second 
20600000000712||with a flat 3 second regen delay for ALL enemies & bosses. 
20600000000713||This Poise overhaul co-exists with the deflect system very well. 
20600000000811||lava found throughout the world now has largely increased damage. 
20600000000812||You will either need to keep your wits about yourself and try to stay out of 
20600000000813||the lava as much as possible, or buff your fire defense as much as possible and heal often. 
20600000000911||Nordgaren's Erd Tools integrated. This gives many customization options for gameplay. 
20600000000912||Configurable through erd_tools configuration settings file.

20600000005011||Stat requirements in Reborn have been altered to every nearest tenth. 
20600000005012||Every ten level milestone will feel more significant.
20600000005013||Whatever level you need to reach so that you can use that fancy weapon you are looking forward to will be easier to keep track of.
20600000005211||Descriptions within Reborn are much more detailed than vanilla and will tell you exact numbers for many effects and much more.

20600000006411||Scarlet rot is a permanent status effect when used on enemies.
20600000006412||Slowly eating away at the vitality of your enemies, until they fall.
20600000006511||In Reborn, new shortcuts and paths are offered all throughout the Overworld and Dungeons of the Lands Between.
20600000006512||Be sure to keep an eye out.
20600000006611||Those known as the Omen, are disenvowed, and cursed beings.
20600000006612||Thought to be cursed by the primordial crucible, reviled in the eyes of the golden order.
20600000006711||Morgott is an Omen
20600000006712||He is a part of those, hated by the believers of the Erd Tree
20600000006713||He is a king, nonetheless.
20600000006714||For he loves The Erd Tree.
20600000006811||Said to be an Empyrean, The Gloam Eyed Queen was the leader of the godskin apostles.
20600000006812||She had a strong disdain for the gods and what they stood for.
20600000006813||She set out to kill the gods with the power of Destined Death, before it was taken by Maliketh, upon her defeat.
20600000007111||A woman whose skin was flayed, smiled with a serene tenderness.
20600000007121||It is said that this woman, named Daedicar, indulged in every form of adultery and wicked pleasure imaginable, 
20600000007122||giving birth to a myriad of grotesque children.
20600000007211||The white-garbed field surgeons come to the aid of 
20600000007212||friend and foe alike by dealing a final deadly thrust 
20600000007213||to spare them from the prolonged agony of a mortal wound. 
20600000007214||A sense of mercy is a catalyst for bloodlust.
20600000007311||The young astrologer gazed at the night sky as she walked. She had always chased the stars every step of her journey. 
20600000007312||Then she met the full moon and, in time, the astrologer became a queen.
20600000007411||Though born into the accursed rot, when the young girl encountered her mentor and his flowing blade, 
20600000007412||she gained wings of unparalleled strength.
20600000007511||Godfrey was a ferocious warrior. When he vowed to become a lord, he took the Beast Regent 
20600000007512||Serosh upon on his back to suppress the ceaseless lust for battle that raged within.
20600000007612||Champions knew what was at stake. Indeed, that is what made them champions.
20600000007711||Long ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. 
20600000007712||Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. 
20600000007713||Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.
20600000010011||The Dungeater, a horrible being, defiled the corpses of his victims.
20600000010012||The souls of his curse would forever be cursed. Their children cursed. Thier children's children.. Cursed.
20600000010013||Never to experience the light of grace in their lives.
20600000010111||Miquella was the only Demigod who would seek peace after the shattering, his haligtree was his greatest attempt to do so.
20600000010112||The other dremigods all fought for shards of the Elden Ring, seeking power.
20600000010211||Just before the shattering,
20600000010212||it is said that Marika's faith in her very own golden order was waning.
20600000010311||Godrick is the weakest of the demigods.
20600000010312||In knowing so, he Mimicked his Brother, Godwyn the Golden, calling himself "Godrick The Golden" 
20600000010313||as a sort of way to remedy his lack of esteem.  
20600000010411||Ranni was the orcastrator of the Night of The Black Knives. 
20600000010412||She loved her relative, Godwyn, but she knew that his death was the necessary stepping stone to shatter
20600000010413||the elden ring and the golden order. 
20600000010511||When Rennala, head of both the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian royal family, 
20600000010512||lost her husband Radagon, her heart went along with him.
20600000010611||Blaidd, who served as Ranni's shadow, was a loyal ally who would defy destiny itself 
20600000010612||if it would have him turn upon his Lady.
20600000010721||"My brother will keep his promise. 
20600000010722||He possesses the wisdom, the allure, of a god— he is the most fearsome Empyrean of all."
20600000010811||The apostles, once said to serve Destined Death, are wielders of the god-slaying black flame.
20600000010812||But after their defeat by Maliketh, the Black Blade, 
20600000010813||the source of their power was sealed away.
20600000010911||Those who look to the cosmos above. 
20600000010912||They read fate in the stars, and are said to be heirs of the glintstone sorcerers. 
20600000010913||But alas, the night sky no longer cradles fate.
20600000011011||Knowledge begins with the recognition of one's ignorance. 
20600000011012||The realization that the search for knowledge is unending. 
20600000011013||When Gideon glimpsed into the will of Queen Marika, he shuddered in fear. 
20600000011112||He led the War against the Giants. 
20600000011113||Faced the Storm Lord, alone. And then, there came a moment. 
20600000011114||When his last worthy enemy fell. 
20600000011115||It was then, as the story is told, that the hue of Lord Godfrey's eyes faded.
20600000011211||The Night's Cavalry, who now wander the dim roads of night, were once led by the Fell Omen 
20600000011212||and were deliverers of death for great warriors, knights, and champions.
20600000011311||The assassins that carried out the deeds of the Night of the Black Knives were 
20600000011312||all women, and rumored to be Numen who had close ties with Marika herself.
20600000011412||It is said Yura became shabriri, the sickness of the flame of frenzy began with Shabriri. 
20600000011413||The most reviled man in all history.
20600000011511||These heresy-inclined perfumers imbibe their own spices to alter body and mind.
20600000011512||Their slow descent into self-destruction is what earned them their name.
20600000011611||Alberich was an aloof yet disturbed heretical sorcerer said to have been driven mad
20600000011612||by jeering tongues during his service to the Roundtable Hold long ago..
20600000011712||Long ago, the Nox invoked the ire of the Greater Will, and were banished deep underground. 
20600000011713||Now they live under a false night sky, in eternal anticipation of their liege. 
20600000011714||Of the coming age of the stars. And their Lord of Night.
20600000011811||The Alabaster lords are the creators of gravity magic.
20600000011812||Radahn was the young pupil of a group of master Alabaster sorcerers.
20600000011911||Radahn loved his horse, Lennard, so much so, that when he outgrew poor Lennard
20600000011912||Radahn could no longer ride Lennard without crushing him.
20600000011913||and so Radahns deep studies into gravity magic began, so that Radahn could once again ride Lennard one day, by making himself weightless.
20600000015011||Standing in direct opposition to the established state religion, they are hunted all their lives.
20600000015012||At the same time, it appears that worship of the deathbed companion seems to be very common in both the Lands Between and the surrounding areas.
20600000015013||Monuments to deathbed companions can be found in a number of the crypts and catacombs throughout the Lands Between,
20600000015014||showing us that they played a much more important role than just resting beside those on the verge of death.
20600000015111||Law of regression states that all things yearn eternally to converge once again to thier place of origin
20600000015121||As symbolized by the discus of light incantations 
20600000015211||Interestingly, Miquella and Malenia, brother and sister, seem to occupy opposite sides of the life and death cycle.
20600000015221||Youth and prosperity. Rot and decay.
20600000015311||Rennala gave Radagon a magnificent sword of moonlight in celebration of their marriage.
20600000015321||Upon their separation, radagon ripped the moonlight out from the sword
20600000015322||and replaced it with golden rays of the divine order, purely out of spite.
20600000020011||Miquella is many things 
20600000020012||A fundamentalist. The Unalloyed. Creator of the Haligtree.
20600000020013||Lord of the Eclipse. Saint Trina of the Cradlesong.
20600000020014||A fearsome Empyrean who has been captured and unresponsive -
