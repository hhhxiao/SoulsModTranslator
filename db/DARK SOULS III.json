  "为了取得暂时的力量，去夺取余火吧。": "Pillage embers, for briefly heightened strength, for your duty.",
  "……好久不见了。": "Well, hasn't it been some time.",

  "太棒了，我果然没看错，你就是这种男人。": "Brilliant. I knew you were no ordinary man.",
  "太棒了，我果然没看错，你就是这种了不得的女人。": "Brilliant. I knew you were a dangerous woman.",
  "尽情入侵、尽情抢夺吧。": "Now invade and pillage all you like.",

  "来侍奉幽邃教堂的罗莎莉亚吧。": "Come on, give yourself to Rosaria, of the Cathedral of the Deep.",
  "你就尽情入侵、尽情抢夺吧。": "Now invade and pillage all you like.",
  "……哦，你已经侍奉罗莎莉亚了啊。": "Ahh, so you've chosen to serve Rosaria after all.",
  "那你也是她的指头，而我的评价也会随之提升。": "She will be pleased with me for finding her another Finger...",
  "……那么，我给你一个忠告：": "But be warned, my friend.",
  "罗莎莉亚的指头，是为她献上舌头的家伙，": "Rosaria's Fingers need only fetch tongues for their mistress.",
  "并不被其他事物束缚。": "Otherwise, we are free, unchained.",
  "你要像黄指头一样认定别人是同伴，也随你高兴，": "Like Yellowfinger, you can choose to believe that all Fingers share camaraderie.",
  "但别要求他人配合你的想法。": "But do not force your romance upon the rest of us.",
  "……所谓罗莎莉亚的指头，是指为她献上舌头的家伙，": "Rosaria's Fingers need only fetch tongues for their mistress.",
  "你要认定别人是同伴，也随你高兴，": "You are free to believe that all Fingers share camaraderie.",
  "……那个浑蛋，还想得寸进尺到什么地步……": "That bastard, who does he think he is?",
  "那只猪……非得让他好好解释清楚。": "He needs to be reminded. Of the grovelling pig that he is...",
  "你不要多管闲事！": "Wait! Stay out of this!",
  "这只猪做了该被宰的事！": "This pig deserves his death!",
  "如果你打算妨碍骑士处私刑，那连你也是我的敌人！": "If you dare question this knight's justice, an enemy of mine you shall be!",
  "死在堆肥里吧！污秽的臭猪！": "Drown in your trough! You filthy pig!",
  "……我应该跟你说过了。": "Didn't I tell you?",
  "罗莎莉亚的指头们，彼此并不是同伴。": "Rosaria's Fingers take no allegiance with one another.",
  "而这只猪做了该被宰的事": "And this pig fully deserved his death.",
  "……至少我是这么认为的。": "At least, as far as I see it.",
  "这样理由就很充分了吧？": "Isn't that enough for you?",
  "呵呵呵……": "(laugh)",
  "这只猪做了该被宰的事": "This pig fully deserved his death.",
  "你这禽兽，好好记在心里……": "You rotten beasts, don't you ever forget...",
  "你们到底……污蔑了什么……": "Just what it is you're ravaging...",
  "……哦，没想到会看到你，真是吓人。": "Well, well, never expected to see you here.",
  "对那种发烂的东西，你居然会有所欲望啊。": "Couldn't resist her any longer, in all her festering glory?",
  "对那种发烂的东西，你居然会有所同情啊。": "Felt sorry for the poor thing, in all her festering glory?",
  "你真是不知满足，连她的灵魂都想污蔑。": "And now you want to ravage her soul, as well.",
  "……不过，既然是我播下的种，是该自己好好收拾。": "I sowed the seeds. I'll prune the mess.",
  "我以女神骑士李奥纳德之名在此发誓。": "I, Leonhard, swear so upon my vows to the goddess.",
  "……哦，你还不放弃啊。": "Well, well, back for more, are you?",
  "你就是这种男人，我果然没看错。": "No ordinary man, are you. I knew it all along.",
  "你就是这种了不得的女人，我果然没看错。": "Vicious one, aren't you. I knew it all along.",
  "你真是不知满足，连灵魂都满是污秽。": "And now you want to ravage her soul, as well.",
  "……那时还能网开一面，但现在我就不能放过你。": "You are no longer of use. You'll run free no more.",
  "她的灵魂决不会被任何人污蔑，": "No one will despoil her soul.",
  "更不用谈像你这种披了人皮的禽兽！": "Certainly no beast wrapped in human skin!",
  "你为什么如此渴求她的灵魂！": "What do you want with her soul?",
  "禽兽有肉体就该知足了吧！": "Isn't flesh enough for a sick beast!",
  "……你这恐怖的、贪心的禽兽……": "You are a vile, rapacious beast...",
  "我是千不该、万不该让你接触她……": "I should have never let you near her...",
  "……快快放弃吧。": "Enough with you, my friend.",
  "女神的骑士永不败阵。": "A knight of the goddess does not die.",
  "哦，你是怎么了？": "What's wrong with you?",
  "你听得到吗？听得到的话，就快住手。": "Can you even hear me? If you can, cease this at once.",
  "现在我还能原谅你。": "Before it's too late.",
  "……我终于明白了。": "I see, I see, as clear as day.",
  "你仅仅是头饥饿的禽兽，": "You are a vile, starved beast.",
  "还是个会危及她安全的东西！": "Much too dangerous for her!",
  "怎么会，我……怎么可能……": "Curses, I can't...die here...",
  "女神啊……": "My dear Goddess...",
  "你这禽兽，搞清楚你龇牙相向的对象。": "You beast. You've trifled with the wrong knight.",
  "你这东西，居然是她的指头啊。": "You are unbecoming of a Finger.",
  "不可饶恕，你这污秽的禽兽……": "Neither she, nor I, will have you, vile beast...",
  "呦，新面孔啊。": "Well, a newcomer I see.",
  "我是这个祭祀场的奴仆，名叫安德烈。": "I am Andre. I serve at this shrine.",
  "如你所见，我是打造武器的铁匠。": "As a humble smith, forging weapons.",
  "你在寻找薪王吧？": "You're in search of the Lords of Cinder, I trust?",
  "这可不是一趟轻松的旅行，你一定需要强有力的武器，": "A toilsome journey I'd wager. You'll require good arms.",
  "所以，让我锻造你的武器吧。": "Let me smith y' weapons.",
  "我是铁匠，也是为此而生的啊。": "I am a smith, such is my purpose.",
  "哟，是你啊。": "Ahh, well met.",
  "人没事就好。": "Tis good to see y' in good health.",
  "那么，你想锻造哪个武器啊？": "What needs smithing this day?",
  "再见了，要平安无事啊。": "Prithee, be careful.",
  "不然就白费我锻造的武器了。": "I don't want to see m' work squandered!",
  "说到武器和防具，基本上都很耐用，": "Weapons and protection are sturdy enough, by and large.",
  "不过，如果你过度使用，当然还是会坏。": "But when overused, they'll eventually break.",
  "所以要是耐久度下降了，就要好好修理啊，": "When their durability is low, repair becomes a necessity.",
  "使用光粉，或者是去营火休息都可以。": "Use a powder, or simply rest at a bonfire.",
  "但万一武器还是坏了，就到我这里来吧。": "But should chance impel them break, bring them me.",
  "我会把它修理得完好如初。": "I'll hammer 'em back into shape.",
  "话说回来，武器坏了，它们自己也会难受吧。": "They take no pleasure in breaking, I assure y'.",
  "所以尽可能善待它们吧。": "So, handle them with care, if y' would.",
  "锻造武器的方式，大致分成两类──": "There are two ways to smith weapons.",
  "单纯强化，还有质变强化。": "Simple reinforcement is one, and infusion the other.",
  "强化很简单，不改变武器的本质，纯粹增强武器；": "Reinforcement is straight forward. It strengthens a weapon without altering its property.",
  "而质变强化就是改变武器的本质，属于高级锻造。": "Infusion is a more advanced form of smithing that infuses an element.",
  "强化要用楔形石，质变强化要用宝石，需要的材料不一样。": "Reinforcement requires titanite, and infusion requires gems.",
  "接着就是我铁匠的工作了。": "Bring the stones, and I'll do the smithing.",
  "不用客气，尽管交给我吧。": "It's m' purpose, after all!",
  "武器是战友，好好锻造的话，它绝对不会背叛你。": "In battle, y' weapons are yer only friends. Forge them well, and they won't let y' down.",
  "哦哦，还有一件事要告诉你。": "Ahh, another matter.",
  "如果想以宝石引起质变强化，必须要有叫作“余烬”的锻造道具。": "Infusing weapons with gems requires a special kind of coal.",
  "有几个特殊的宝石，仅凭我手上的余烬没办法使用。": "My humble coals won't be any use infusing more unusual gems.",
  "身为铁匠这样说真的很没面子，但这件事我也束手无策。": "I know, it's an awful shame, but it's all I have.",
  "抱歉，不要太责怪我，": "Oh, please, don't give me that look.",
  "别看我这样，我心思可是很细腻的啊。": "Believe it or not, I'm quite thin-skinned.",
  "哦，这个是……不死队的余烬啊。": "Oh, my...this coal is from the Undead Legion...",
  "法兰的监视者们，就是用这余烬锻造武器……": "Used to forge the weapons of Farron's Abyss Watchers.",
  "这是贵重物品啊。竟然把这东西交给我，真令人高兴啊。": "A fine prize. I'm honoured to be endued with it.",
  "这下子，特殊的宝石也能用在质变强化上啦。": "Now I'll be equipped to infuse special gems.",
  "对啊，这是我第一次碰上，我已经开始技痒啦。": "Praise the gods, eh. Time to put this brawn to use!",
  "哦哦，这个是……那位巨人的余烬啊。": "My, my... The coal of that peaceable giant.",
  "真令人怀念。不过这下子，他也不可能活命了吧……": "Seems like ages past. I imagine his passing was long ago.",
  "真难过啊，他人还不赖的……": "I miss the old bugger, I do.",
  "谢啦。他留下来的余烬，我可不能浪费掉。": "My thanks. I'll be sure this coal is put to good use.",
  "我绝对会锻造出很棒的武器。": "I'll be smithing weapons never afore seen by the likes of y'!",
  "对他来说，这才是最好的供养吧。": "It's but a small service, to pay my humble respects.",
  "……你手上的那个余烬……": "Lords... Where didye hap'n upon this coal?",
  "太深沉了，已经是接近深渊的东西了……": "This is much too dark. I see the Abyss in it...",
  "但既然我身为铁匠，只要你开口，我就会使用它。": "Yet, a smith I remain. I won't turn down a request.",
  "所以，不要忘了啊。": "But forget not,",
  "你正为了火以及人们战斗……而我也一样啊，": "Your fight is for the flame, and for y' fellow kin. Just like mine.",
  "虽然身负和诅咒没什么不同的使命，但也就是这样，才有希望可言吧？": "A cursed fate this may be, but hope remains, does it not?",
  "哟，是你啊，等你很久了。": "Oh, you've returned. I was hoping to see y'.",
  "这是那个叫霍克伍德的受挫家伙，寄放在我这的。": "That crestfallen arse Hawkwood, he handed me this.",
  "而且他离开的样子也挺奇怪的，": "He's changed a great deal since he left this place.",
  "他一脸悲痛，说想把这个交给你啊……": "Graven of face, he asked me to give it y'.",
  "……对，找你就这件事而已。": "Well, now that that task is concluded...",
  "那么，你想要锻造什么武器？": "What would y' ha' me smith today?",
  "给我住手！": "Enough of that!",
  "混账东西……": "Beshrew your heart...",
  "……你可不要会错意了。": "Overstep not yer bounds, cousin.",
  "就算我是奴仆，也不是你的奴隶。": "I may serve, but I'm no slave.",
  "你妨碍到我工作了，快滚吧。": "I have business I must attend. Be gone.",
  "哦哦，是你啊。": "Oh, by the by.",
  "如果你找到叫原素碎片的东西，记得拿到我这里来，": "If you find any Estus Shards, bring 'em 'ere.",
  "你手上的两个原素瓶，不管哪一个我都能帮忙强化。": "They can be used to reinforce either of y' Estus Flasks.",
  "原素瓶是你们的宝物，也是维系生命与意志的东西吧？": "Without those flasks, you'd want for life or focus.",
  "而且这还能一直沿用下去，稍微下点功夫，不会有损失啊。": "And they'll always stay with y'. Why not treat 'em well?",
  "哦，这个是……不死队的余烬，还有长这样的啊。": "Well, well... What's the Undead Legion doing with a coal such as this?",
  "听说法兰的监视者是靠结晶老者的碎片借得力量，": "I'd heard one of the Crystal Sages had sided with Farron's Abyss Watchers.",
  "看来真有这么一回事。": "I suppose it must be true.",
  "你啊，这可是法术余烬啊，我也是第一次看到。": "You should know, this coal is imbued with magic. First one I've ever seen.",
  "因为不管做学问还是贤者，都不可能跟我扯上边吧？": "Hardly a surprise is it? I've never been one for books or wise men.",
  "哎呀、哎呀，来了个灰烬大人啊。": "A pleasure to make thine acquaintance, Ashen One.",
  "……噢噢，这位大人……": "Oh thou'rt...",
  "……哎呀，没事，灰烬大人。": "Oh, no, 'tisn't anything, Ashen One.",
  "我老太婆是这个祭祀场的侍女。": "I am but a humble handmaid of the shrine.",
  "不管是武器、防具、道具，还是法术类的东西……": "Weapons, armour, trinkets, and spells...",
  "只要是能帮助您完成使命的必备物品，都准备好了。": "I've lots of little things to ease the burden of a weary traveller.",
  "……当然了，我这老太婆也是不死人，但我不是做慈善事业啊。": "...And yes, I'm Undead, too, but not so charitable as to give my goods away.",
  "灰烬大人啊，去夺取灵魂，再拿过来吧。": "Ashen One, fetch souls, and bring them to me.",
  "说到底，这才是大人，您赖以维生的方式吧？": "As is thy wont, no?",
  "噢噢，灰烬大人，欢迎您啊。": "Ahh, well met, Ashen One.",
  "找我这个老太婆，有什么事啊？": "How may I be of service?",
  "灰烬大人，欢迎再拿点儿灵魂过来啊。": "Ashen One, be sure to bring more souls.",
  "……灰烬大人，如果您嫌我老太婆的东西卖得不全，": "Ashen One, if my wares are not to thy satisfaction,",
  "麻烦您，拿骨灰过来吧。": "bring me umbral ash.",
  "如此一来，老太婆我就能用骨灰变点儿新东西出来了。": "With ash, I'll fashion new wares.",
  "靠死亡吃饭，不就是我们的诅咒吗？": "Is it not our sorry fate, to sup on death?",
  "……哎呀、哎呀，您把骨灰拿来了啊。": "Gracious. Passing fine ash thou'st given.",
  "那么，就把这骨灰当成我老太婆的粮食吧。": "Let this ash bestow nourishment.",
  "还希望新商品会讨您喜欢啊。": "I only hope these new wares content thee...",
  "不过，这骨灰怎么还是温的啊？": "And awfully warm, at that.",
  "暖得像这人刚刚还活着一样……": "Almost as if it had lived, mere moments ago...",
  "哎呀，不好意思，我多嘴了啊。": "Oh, forgive an old woman's idle prate.",
  "灰烬大人怎么可能做这么残忍的事情……": "I'm sure an ashen one such as thee would never indulge such base contrivances...",
  "不过话说回来，您也明白，": "And even temptation were to prevail...",
  "我这老太婆可是很贪心的……": "I'd overlook a little mischief if thou would'st but thy purse-strings loosen...",
  "嘻嘻、嘻嘻嘻……": "Kee hee hee...",
  "……灰烬大人，您又拿来一份可怜虫的骨灰了啊。": "Ashen One, what woeful umbral ash is this.",
  "这是份愚人的骨灰……可以换得的物品也少得很吧。": "This barren dust, stuff of a fool, won't yield aught.",
  "那么，这是在哪里捡到的呢？只是觉得好玩才问问，告诉我这个老太婆吧。": "Where did'st thou happen upon the stuff? Tell me, for the sport.",
  "……哦，原来如此……": "Oh, yes, I see...",
  "真是可怜虫，居然在这衰亡之世里做梦……": "Clinging to lofty dreams in this dying world...more's the pity.",
  "果然如此，这是份愚人的骨灰啊。": "It must come from one most foolish indeed.",
  "大人也这么觉得吧？": "Would'st thou not agree?",
  "……不愧是灰烬大人。": "As the Ashen One ought be...",
  "正所谓轻浮为不智之举吧。": "Little time for japery, mm...",
  "咿嘻嘻……": "(laugh)",
  "快住手啊！": "Stop that!",
  "居然对我这老太婆……做出这么残忍的事……": "Vile brute. I'm but a poor old woman...",
  "大人您也挺过分的。": "A malicious sort, thou art.",
  "不过很遗憾……因为一直被传火的诅咒束缚，": "But, marvel on. Remember well, I am Undead.",
  "我老太婆就是这样，不会死。": "Bound forever by the shrine's curse...",
  "与其关心这件事，您不如好好后悔吧，": "Well, little sense in timidity now.",
  "我这老太婆可是贪得无厌，到死了也无所谓啊。": "I'll have thee for all thou'rt worth...",
  "我老太婆刚准备好新商品，": "I've just come upon some fine new wares.",
  "您的直觉还真灵啊。": "How is it thou seem'st privy to this knowledge?",
  "哎呀、哎呀，还真是稀奇，": "Well, fancy that.",

  "不过，这样也值得啦。": "But in the end, it all paid off.",
  "来，来看看吧。我想应该有派得上用场的东西。": "Take a good look. They're sure to be of some use.",
  "这里还真是无聊，就算拿着赃物也没有地方用，对吧？": "Oh, this place is a bore. What good is thievery if you've nowhere to go?",
  "再见了，我接下来要离开一阵子，暂时告别了。": "Good-bye. I will leave for some time. So long for now.",
  "你要平安无事啊，不然的话，我就白费力气了。": "Do stay safe, you hear? Or my efforts will have been for naught.",

  "……如何？办得到吗？": "Well? Can you assure me of this?",
  "……很好。": "Very well.",
  "你也不是蠢蛋，应该明白承诺的轻重。": "You are no fool. I take it you understand the weight of a promise.",

  "等你回心转意，再来找我。": "Though you're welcome back if you change your mind.",
  "……哦，回心转意了吗？": "Have you changed your mind?",
  "也就是记载魔法奥秘的卷轴，把它带来就好。": "In the form of scrolls detailing the secrets of sorcery.",
  "就是这样，办得到吗？": "Can you make this promise?",
  "……别想了，你不适合魔法，": "You'd better not. Sorcery is not for everyone.",
  "也不需要勉强自己去学。": "And should never be forced.",
  "你有你的路，但不是魔法这一条。": "You have your own methods. Sorcery need not be one of them.",
  "就是这样。": "Don't let it bother you.",
  "无火的余灰，你必然有你的使命吧？": "You're Unkindled. Shouldn't you get back to your duty?",
  "……哦，你不放弃啊。": "Oh, I thought you'd already given up.",

  "学习魔法就是这么一回事。": "It is either a natural fit, or no fit at all.",
  "……哦，你有什么事吗？": "Well, well... There's something different about you, isn't there?",
  "……哦，是吗。": "Yes, I see.",
  "那么，快走吧。": "On your way, then.",
  "这里是我的书斋，我想继续安静看书了。": "This is my study, and I've plenty of reading to do.",
  "……哦，是你啊，真烦人。": "Oh, enough of you, already.",
  "你真的有事找我？": "Do you have business with me?",

  "啧，听不进去啊。": "Is that how it is?",
  "唉，那就没办法了。": "Then we are through and done.",
  "只好让你闭嘴了！": "Enjoy your long sleep!",
  "……唉，我还是很讨厌杀人啊……": "Gods, this business never did agree with me...",
  "可恶，竟然在这种地方……": "Curses, how could this...",
  "我还真的退步了……": "I've lost...my touch...",
  "唉，你实在是很烦！": "Oh, I've had it with you!",
  "抱歉，只好让你闭嘴了！": "Not another word will come out of your mouth!",
  "就给你个血淋淋的教训，让你明白不良居心终有报应！": "Perhaps this will teach you!\nThat petty mischief will not go overlooked!",
  "……死小鬼，终于闭嘴了吧……": "That ought to keep you quiet...",
  "哦，你回来了啊。": "Oh, you're back, then.",
  "再提醒你，我是彼海姆的欧贝克，能传授你魔法。": "Again, I'm Orbeck of Vinheim, here to teach you sorceries.",
  "但是你要先记住，关于魔法师的理想，所谓龙的二元性……": "Let us begin with the basics. The ideal sorcerer bears the twin faces of the dragon...",
  "……别一脸嫌弃嘛。": "...Oh, you could at least act as if you're paying attention!",
  "哈哈哈。": "(laugh)",
  "既然你跟我搭话，代表你想学魔法吧？": "I suppose this means that you're after sorceries?",
  "你来得正好，我正想要休息一下。": "Perfect timing, too. I'm in need of a diversion.",
  "嗯？怎么吗？你是忘了什么吗？": "Oh, what is it? Forgot something?",
  "还真是不令我意外。": "That would be quite like you.",
  "再见啦。": "Come again.",
  "祝你顺风。": "Promise to stay safe.",
  "喂，要记得遵守承诺啊。": "Don't forget what you promised.",
  "喂，祝你顺风。": "Promise to stay safe.",
  "说是模仿学院，我也做得很开心啊……": "It's been nice running our own little school.",
  "……抱歉，你可能会嫌我烦，但你可别忘了。": "I don't mean to seem overbearing, but have you forgotten?",
  "就是记载魔法奥秘的卷轴，把它带来给我。": "In the form of scrolls detailing the secrets of sorcery.",
  "这是你自己许下的承诺啊。": "I hope you're not one to break a promise.",
  "……喂，你把承诺忘了吗？": "Have you forgotten our agreement?",
  "我现在很饥渴──对魔法的饥渴。": "I am starved. For sorceries.",
  "我可不打算无偿劳动……": "Come now, I've been charitable long enough.",
  "哦，有个东西要给你。": "Oh, I have something for you.",
  "你也差不多到了可以自称魔法师的境地，": "You're a fine sorcerer now, no mistake.",
  "也该拥有这个证明了。": "You should have something to prove it.",
  "收下吧，难得我送人东西不求回报喔。": "Go on. If I'm giving something away, you'd better well take it.",
  "……你喜欢嬉戏吗？": "How do you like gimmicks, friend?",
  "这是消除声响的魔法师标记，也是一种暗号。": "This is a sign, a cipher employed by sorcerers who use quietude to their advantage.",
  "有了这个，就算不认识彼此，也不会互相为敌。": "With this, you can be sure to tell friend from foe from your very first encounter.",
  "虽然这已经是太久远的老规矩，": "It's a very old practice at this point...",
  "但是你早就得到认识它的资格，我才会告诉你。": "...but one that you deserve to know.",
  "……喂，你可不要随便杀人啊。": "It is folly to claim lives recklessly, friend. Do not be tempted.",
  "不管对方是谁，你又夺走谁的性命，总有一天都会有报应。": "No matter the victim's stature, every killing has a consequence.",
  "我弄脏了双手，却没发觉这个真理。": "Even as I bloodied my hands, I never realised this simple truth.",
  "哼，还真是个蠢蛋……": "Hmph. There I was, the very definition of a fool...",
  "……我曾是彼海姆的密探。": "In Vinheim, I was an assassin.",
  "是披着魔法师的外皮，干着拿钱办事的杀手。": "A sorcerer only in name, a killer for hire.",
  "当时我真是太蠢了，还坚信有朝一日我能学到正统的魔法。": "What a fool I was, thinking one day I would learn real sorceries.",
  "结果成了不死人，被逐出学院……": "When I became Undead, I was exiled from the school.",
  "但在这里，我反而能接触到魔法的奥秘。": "But here I am, now, exploring the depths of sorcery.",
  "都是拜你所赐……": "All thanks to you, I might add.",
  "……不过，你也学得真快。": "You've been very studious.",
  "我已经没东西可以教你了。": "In fact, I have nothing more to teach.",
  "……时机也差不多成熟了。": "Well, I suppose it's high time to call it quits.",
  "再这么下去，我们之间的承诺就要失效了。": "I would hate to see our agreement end sourly.",
  "我不愿意让这种事情发生。": "Better left tucked away, as a nice memory.",
  "……你是个了不起的男人，": "You are no ordinary man.",
  "……你是个了不起的女人，": "You are no ordinary woman.",
  "居然学会这么多的魔法。": "All these sorceries, and you've mastered every one.",
  "如果在龙学院，你一定会……": "If this were the Dragon School, you'd be...",
  "……不，八成会遭到严重排挤，再被学院放逐吧。": "..well, overtly despised, and banished from the place.",
  "……不过，嗯，时机也差不多成熟了。": "Well, I suppose it's time I packed my bags.",
  "是我没办法继续履行承诺。": "I would hate to see our agreement end sourly.",
  "我不希望这样。": "Better left tucked away, as a pleasant memory.",
  "哦，这……真让我吃惊。": "Oh, my... This is stupendous.",
  "没想到还有未知的法兰不死队魔法。": "Then the Undead Legion of Farron possesses sorceries quite unknown.",
  "谢谢你，你的确有遵守承诺。": "Thank you, for upholding your end of the bargain.",
  "就算我在那儿花费再多时间，也不会知道这个吧。": "I doubt I ever would have made this discovery alone.",
  "好了，来解读吧。新的魔法必定会对你有用处。": "Now, let us unravel the thing, so you may put these new sorceries to use.",
  "……你找到一个不得了的东西啊。": "Oh, my! You've made quite the discovery!",
  "这是那位大帽子罗根的卷轴，": "This is a scroll of the prodigious Big Hat Logan.",
  "是远古彼海姆失传的伟大魔法。": "A masterful sorcerer, long missed in Vinheim.",
  "没想到像我这种人，也有接触它的一天……": "And now, we have his scroll, right here in my very hands.",
  "……真是不敢相信。": "Unfathomable.",
  "这是结晶魔法，是只存在传说中的白龙力量……": "This is a crystal sorcery, created by the pale dragon,\nthought only to exist in legend...",
  "感谢你，这可是神秘啊。": "I am ever grateful to you. This is truly sublime.",
  "我拿不出能报答你的东西……": "I am afraid this is a debt I cannot repay, only...",
  "但是我会竭尽全力解读它，你等着吧。": "I will be sure to unravel it for you. Just a moment.",
  "哦，这……可稀奇了，": "Oh, my... This is very unusual.",
  "居然是远古的黄金魔法国度──乌拉席露。": "It's from Oolacile, an ancient land of golden sorceries.",
  "八成连龙学院都没有失传这么久的魔法卷轴。": "Not even the Dragon School possesses such a long-lost scroll.",
  "黄衣研究者要是看到它，必定会垂涎三尺": "What would the xanthous scholars say, with their ridiculous headwear.",
  "……而且戴着那个奇妙的头冠垂涎喔。": "They would simply slaver over this find.",
  "你是怎么了？": "What is this about?",
  "你疯了吗？": "Have you lost your wits?",
  "看来没救了。": "Seems it's too late.",
  "很可惜，一切到此为止吧！": "With regret, I will end this here and now!",
  "……啊啊，我还是逃不过这个下场……": "Gods, what have I done...",
  "再见了，那些模仿学院的事情，我做得很开心啊……": "Farewell. We had a nice little school going.",
  "你为什么……": "But, why...",
  "东西用完了，就要丢了是吗……": "Is that all that I'm worth?",
  "也……好……": "So be it...",
  "我的梦也作够了……": "It was nice while it lasted...",
  "哦，你是……无火的余灰啊。": "Ah-hah, Unkindled are we?",
  "欢迎来到我家。": "Welcome to my abode.",
  "我是柯弭库斯，是位老咒术师。": "I am Cornyx, an old pyromancer.",

  "怎么样？想不想跟着我这老头子，学习咒术啊？": "Care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?",
  "你很聪明，懂得所谓奇货可居。": "Most wise. A chance encounter should not be squandered.",
  "那么，我是大沼的柯弭库斯，": "To reiterate, I am Cornyx, of the Great Swamp.",
  "请多指教了。": "The pleasure is mine.",
  "你还真笨，人说老乌鸦才有这般智慧啊。": "Most foolish. This old crow has a little knowledge of his own, you know.",
  "唉，不了解也罢。": "Bah. No sense in spelling it out.",
  "这事情也急不得，如果你脑袋变聪明了，再过来吧。": "I will not rush you. You will return, once you are enlightened.",
  "毕竟我们俩都是不死人，虽然也是因为这样被束缚了。": "We are, after all, both Undead. And both prisoners, in our own ways.",
  "哦，是你啊，真快啊。": "Well, hello, That was certainly quick.",
  "哦，是你啊，真慢啊。": "Well, hello. You certainly took your time.",
  "然后呢？有没有稍微变聪明点儿？": "Are you any more enlightened on this occasion?",
  "你想干什么？": "What are you doing?",
  "还不快住手。": "Cease this foolishness.",
  "你做这种事，到底有什么好处？": "Little bird, what's to be gained?",
  "哎呀，回来了，无火的余灰啊。": "Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One.",
  "首先，我先感谢你。": "I wish to express my gratitude.",
  "我身为咒术师也是敬陪末座，听人说是营火──能看到那么神秘的火焰，真是三生有幸。": "For trusting a lowly pyromancer, and allowing me to gaze upon this majestic flame.",
  "……就如同我答应你的，我要教你咒术。": "As promised, I will impart pyromancies to you.",
  "首先，对你来说，火也是不可或缺的。": "But first, you'll need a flame of your own.",
  "小心点儿，不要害得自己被火烧光了。": "Careful you don't burn yourself with it.",
  "师父最喜欢勤奋学习的弟子了。": "I am pleased to have a pupil as dedicated as you.",
  "记得再回来啊。": "Do not be gone for long.",
  "没了弟子的师父可是不象样啊。": "What is a teacher without a pupil?",
  "说到学习咒术，我是师父，而你是弟子。": "To learn pyromancies, you must vow to become my pupil.",
  "就是这么一回事，哎呀，就当作是卖给我这老头面子吧。": "I know, I know, but such is the way of the world. Respect your elders, and so on.",
  "不讲咒术，在这世上做人处事就是这样。": "And pyromancy, of course, is no exception.",
  "对了，如果你想要学习更高阶的咒术，那你需要有咒术书。": "Oh, we'll need a pyromancy tome to learn more advanced pyromancies.",
  "虽然这是旁门左道，不过是条最快的捷径。": "Though unorthodox, that would be the most expedient way to make progress.",
  "如果这里是大沼，我就会说“你有那个时间找书，还不如去做些严酷的修行”啊。": "If this were the Great Swamp, and you had the luxury of time, we could have trained you the hard way.",

  "故乡之名为伊札里斯。说真的，我还真想见识原始的咒术。": "The place is called Izalith. Oh, how I wish to behold a primal pyromancy.",
  "哎呀，不过这也只是传说，是不是真的就不保证了。": "Well, these are old tales. No one knows where the truth begins, or ends.",
  "对了，关于你找到的那本地下墓地的咒术书啊……": "Ahh, you found this tome in the Catacombs...",
  "书里的咒术特性很接近混沌。": "This spell is akin to chaos.",
  "说不定真的和咒术的故乡──伊札里斯有所关联……": "It may even serve as a link to Izalith, home of pyromancies...",
  "……我说啊，无火的余灰啊。": "Heed my words, Unkindled One.",
  "要对火心存敬畏。": "Fear the fire.",
  "过去咒术的始源──伊札里斯，曾被自身产生的火焰毁灭。": "The home of pyromancy, Izalith, was scorched by the very fire it created.",
  "那很有可能是混沌，也就是魔女扭曲的火焰所为。": "Undoubtedly, it was a flame of chaos, tangled by a witch's hand.",
  "话又说回来，那火焰和营火的差异，谁又能分辨得出来啊？": "But who's to say that this Bonfire's flame is any different?",

  "还有，很抱歉我不是女人啊。": "If only I were a woman.",
  "……我不能收下这本书。": "I'm afraid I cannot accept this.",
  "这本咒术书是黑暗──是以人心底层不可触碰的火焰催生而成的。": "This pyromancy tome is dark, and delves into the depths of men, where an untouchable flame resides.",

  "我向你道歉，居然把人和水蛭看成同类，真是失礼至极。": "Accept my apologies, for mistaking you for one of those leeches.",
  "那么，你在这个地方做什么？": "So, what business have you here?",
  "这里是畸形生物的住所，就连我也不例外啊。": "This is a land of monstrosities. And I am no exception.",
  "……哦，你想要我当你的随从……": "Would I serve you?",
  "也就是说，你和传火有关，对吧。": "Then you must be involved in linking of the fire.",
  "……好啊，没关系。我一直被囚禁，也差不多觉得厌倦了。": "Ahh, very well. I can do very little holed up here.",
  "我是罪业之都的卡露拉，愿意成为你的随从。": "I am Feria, of the Profaned Capital, and I hereby enter into your service.",

  "……你又怎么了？有什么事吗？": "What is it? Something else?",
  "没关系，你不用顾虑我。无论如何，我都已经无法动弹了。": "Ahh, don't fret over me. I'm stuck here anyway.",
  "搞什么，你还是和水蛭同群啊。": "Why, you're one of those leeches after all.",
  "那真是好笑，为什么还要装作是人呢？": "How dare you feign humanity.",

  "我能够回报你的，就只有魔法了": "The only thing that might interest you is my sorcery.",
  "……而且是活该受人忌讳的暗之魔法啊。": "Although my dark arts are a detestable sort.",
  "难道你真的想学吗？": "That wouldn't interest you, would it?",
  "你这活该被雷劈的家伙。": "You're a wicked one, aren't you?",
  "不过，算了。人类是黑暗的代称，你也不例外，": "Very well. Humans are of the dark, and you are no different.",
  "只是差在愿不愿意正眼看待这件事罢了。": "Some may avert their eyes, but the truth remains the truth.",
  "但是你要记得，人们却不这么想。": "Be careful though. Few humans are privy to this knowledge.",
  "我所说的事情，就当成我和你的秘密吧。": "Let it be a secret, between you and I...",

  "因为你是我的弟子啊。": "You're my apprentice, don't forget.",
  "你要好好记住。": "There is one thing that you should know.",
  "不过看你是会怕得裹足不前，还是会因为思念家乡而迫不及待——": "Whether the fear will spark self-reflection, or a ruinous nostalgia...",
  "这由你自己决定。": "...is up to you entirely.",
  "……不管你做哪个决定，都能被允许吧。": "Fear not, your choice will bring you no scorn.",
  "啊，就是因为这样，我才会惹人嫌吧。": "Ahh, it's little wonder my kindness is lost on most...",
  "……哦，这个是……咒术书啊。": "Oh, a pyromancy tome, have we?",
  "伊札里斯的魔女──克拉娜……是魔女的咒术啊，真是有趣。": "Quelana, Witch of Izalith...well, this is a fascinating pyromancy...",

  "我就会拼了命解读看看。": "I will unravel the thing the best I can.",
  "还有啊，当上你的师父好像也挺有趣的啊。": "Besides. It will be nice to play master for once.",
  "……哦，又拿来了咒术书啊。": "Ohh, another pyromancy tome, have we?",

  "你这男人还真过分啊。": "Fiendish little lad, you...",
  "你这女人还真过分啊。": "Fiendish little lass, you...",
  "而且是和黑暗相近的咒术，这的确很适合我啊。": "And one that resonates with the dark, yes, well suited to me...",
  "好吧，既然是你的要求，": "Very well. If this is your wish.",
  "……哦，这个是……圣典啊。": "Oh, is this a Divine Tome?",
  "你到底在想什么？": "What on earth are you thinking?",
  "不管是圣典还是奇迹，都和我不相干。": "I wouldn't go near a Divine Tome or any so-called miracle.",
  "对那些家伙而言，我是唯恐避之不及的人物吧。": "And casters of miracles are sure to steer clear of me.",
  "……所以你啊，拜托，": "So, please.",
  "不要太为难我了。": "Don't torture me so.",
  "……啊，是你啊，你": "Ahh, you, how could you...",
  "……唉。": "Ahhh....",
  "我很清楚，你是我的恩人。": "I know, I know. I owe my life to you.",
  "没关系。只在这里念给你听就行。": "Fine, then. Just this once, I will tell you this tale.",
  "……不过，我也是第一次做这种事，": "But do understand, it will be my first time.",
  "就当是在玩吧，不要对我要求太高啊。": "I'll have no sniggering, should I err.",
  "你怎么了？": "What's wrong?",
  "你还真是过分啊。": "How could you?",
  "你真是善变啊……": "You're a fickle one...",
  "还有，真是残酷啊……": "And vicious...",
  "……哦，你想要帮我……？": "You're here to save me...?",
  "但我除了是有罪之人，还是禁忌的人心深渊之子。": "But I am guilty. A wretched child of the Abyss.",

  "……哦，这样啊。你这男人还真是怪。": "Oh, really. You are no ordinary man.",
  "……哦，这样啊。你这女人还真是怪。": "Oh, really. You are no ordinary woman.",
  "不过，好吧，我也厌倦被囚禁的生活了。": "Very well. Besides, I've grown tired of imprisonment.",
  "我是卡露拉，我答应你提出的要求。": "I am Karla, and I accept your proposal.",
  "……哦，你在迷惘吧？": "Oh, are you lost on your journey?",
  "正所谓有路可行之人才会迷路，": "No matter, today's lost are conquerors tomorrow.",
  "这是你身为英雄的证明啊。": "It only demonstrates the makings of a champion.",
  "……而不管你做什么决定……": "And besides, whatever your choice...",
  "都不会改变我对你的想法和感激之情。": "It will not change my sense of gratitude, or how I think of you.",
  "……是哪位？": "Ahh, who's there?",
  "有谁在那里吗？": "Is someone there, anyone?",
  "啊，若您在那里的话，请过来触碰我。": "Ahh, please, whoever you are, touch me.",

  "那么，触碰我、让我从黑暗中解放出来的您，肯定是英雄大人对吧？": "Your touch has freed me from the darkness. You are a Champion, then?",
  "我太软弱了，所以我想，我一定没办法成为防火女。": "I am weak, and unfit to tend the flames,",
  "就算如此，英雄大人，您还愿意让我来侍奉您吗？": "But if it would not trouble you, might I enter into your service, instead?",
  "啊，非常感谢您，英雄大人。": "Oh, thank you, sweet Champion.",

  "所以我能够让您听到关于奇迹的故事。": "I would be pleased to share the tales of miracles with you.",
  "只是，我知道的故事其实也不算多，": "Although to be honest, I only know a few.",
  "若是我手上有圣典，就可以让您听更多的故事了。": "But if I had a divine tome, I could tell you many tales and more.",
  "……啊，不过，我的眼睛已经看不见了。": "Ahh, only I cannot see...",
  "真的很不好意思，只能请您找点字圣典了。": "Terribly sorry, but you'll have to find me a Divine Tome in braille.",

  "说不定这故事很适合您听呢。": "Perhaps the kind you might enjoy...",
  "……啊，这个是……": "Oh, what's this...",
  "英雄大人，这是本禁忌的圣典。": "Champion of Ash, this Divine Tome is forbidden...",
  "是描述潜藏在人心中深沉黑暗的故事……我想这并不适合您听。": "These are dark tales of things that lurk deep within men... These stories would not please you...",
  "不过，若是您要求，我当然还是会读给您听。": "Of course, if you insist, I will read them for you.",

  "……但是，要是你也和那些笨蛋一样想逞英雄，": "If like the others, you're fool enough to play the champion...",
  "就去那里，进入那个废弃教会吧。": "Then go on ahead, traipse right past the abandoned church.",
  "接着凄惨地死去吧，": "You'll face death, and it won't be pretty.",
  "在挫折受尽之前多死几次吧。": "Enough death to leave you broken, time after time.",

  "我劝你放弃吧，那个女的连防火女都当不了，根本一无是处。": "Well, she's a lost cause. Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.",
  "亏我还把她带到这里，准备都准备好了，居然那付德性。": "After I brought her all this way, and got her all ready.",
  "看那样子，她已经是废人了吧。": "She's beyond repair, I tell you.",
  "我劝你不要和那个女的牵扯太深啦。": "The woman's a lost cause.",
  "她连防火女都当不了，根本一无是处。": "Couldn't even become a Fire Keeper.",
  "已经是个废人了。": "She's beyond repair, I tell you.",

INJUNCTION.  Because BNEA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this EULA were not specifically enforced, you agree that BNEA and/or its licensors and suppliers shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this EULA, in addition to such other remedies as BNEA may otherwise have under applicable law.",

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BNEA, its licensors, its suppliers, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from all damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising, directly or indirectly, from any violation of this EULA by you or from your acts and omissions to act in using the Game.  BNEA reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n14.1. YOU AND BNEA AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.  THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (A) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA; (B) THIS EULA; OR (C) YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE GAME.  IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.\n14.2. However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or BNEA may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.\n14.3. This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from BNEA for you.\n14.4. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and provides more limited discovery.  It follows different rules than court proceedings and is subject to very limited review by courts.  The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BNEA ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\n14.5. You and BNEA agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.  If you and BNEA do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or BNEA may commence an arbitration.  Written notice to BNEA must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Legal & Business Affairs Department, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., 2051 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054, USA. \n14.6. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section.  The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at http://www.adr.org.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this EULA. \n14.7. The AAA will administer the arbitration.  It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the country/region where you live or at another mutually agreed location. \n14.8. If you seek $10,000 or less, BNEA agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  BNEA agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and BNEA according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if applicable. \n14.9. YOU AND BNEA AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE.  THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.  You and BNEA also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this EULA and all other actions or arbitrations.\n14.10. If the agreement in this Section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and BNEA agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire Section shall be unenforceable, and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration. \n14.11. Notwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. \n14.12. This Section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this Section, notwithstanding Section 16 (Governing Law), such provisions will not apply to you.",

  "我心中刻画着神明的荣耀，对火的骄傲，以及对黑暗的恐惧。": "At once, I am the honour of the gods, the glory of fire, and the fear of the dark.",
  "因此，我无法原谅──": "Thou shalt not go unpunished.",
  "你们那些背叛、亵渎，还有卑贱的渴望！": "For thy treachery, thy profanity, and thy shameless yearning!",

  "环印城是神明为矮人们所造的流放地，是座围墙耸立的隔离城市": "The forsaken Ringed City was walled off by the gods to contain the pygmies.",
  "……黑暗灵魂也不是你该接近的东西啊。": "...and the dark soul is better left well alone...",
  "……对，就像你猜的一样，": "Ahh, yes, it's just what you'd guess.",
  "根据传说，环印城就是末世所在，": "Legend says that the Ringed City lies at the end of the earth.",

  "环印城是矮人的流放地，黑暗灵魂也不是你该接近的东西啊。": "The pygmies were exiled to the Ringed City.\nAnd no one should go near the dark soul.",
  "……你还是要去，对吧？": "You're not willing to reconsider, are you?",
  "这样也好，使命也不是人人都有，": "Well, that's just fine. It's a rare thing, to have a true duty.",
  "你要好好珍惜。": "Don't go and take it for granted, I suppose.",

  "况且你这种角色心里在盘算什么，我老早就知道了": "Thy scheme is known to me, I know what it is thou desirest.",
  "……你想要黑暗灵魂，对吧？": "...The dark soul, no?",
  "要不是这样，谁会想来这种鬼地方？": "Why else wouldst one deign to visit this dung heap?",
  "别装啦，我和你是一伙的啊。": "Give rest to thy falsity, I would be an ally to thee.",
