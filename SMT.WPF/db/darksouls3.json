Those terms that by their nature are intended to survive this EULA shall survive this EULA.": "9.禁令。由于本协议若未具体执行，BNE ASIA将蒙受不可挽回之损失，阁下同意BNE ASIA与/或其授权者应有权，在不受到限制、其他安全或损失防护影响下，享有就违反本协议部分之适当补偿，以及其他BNE ASIA根据适用法律得享有之其他补偿。",
  "10. PRIVACY.  BNEA respects your privacy rights.

  "11. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The Game has been developed entirely at private expense and is provided as a “Commercial Computer Game” or “restricted computer Game.” Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Game clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013 or as set forth in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Game Restricted Rights clauses at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable.  The Contractor/Manufacturer is BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Inc., 4-5-15 Higashi Shinagawa, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 140-8590.  The Developer is FromSoftware, Inc., G-PLACE Sasazuka 2-26-2 Sasazuka Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 151-0073.": "11.适用法律与辖区。本协议应根据新加坡法律解读并受其管治。",
  "12. INJUNCTION.  Because BNEA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this EULA were not specifically enforced, you agree that BNEA and/or its licensors and suppliers shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this EULA, in addition to such other remedies as BNEA may otherwise have under applicable law.": "12.杂项。若本协议内任何条文被视为无效或无法执行，此等条文应删除之，其余条文应继续有效并执行之，无效或无法执行之条文视为不存在。BNE ASIA未就阁下或他人违约事项采取行动，并未褫夺其就后续或类似违约事项采取行动之权利。您不得指派或转移此协议或您因此取得之权利，从事此等行为之意图亦为无效。本协议详述阁下与BNE ASIA间之了解与共识，包含所有协议事项。",
  "13. INDEMNITY.  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BNEA, its licensors, its suppliers, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from all damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising, directly or indirectly, from any violation of this EULA by you or from your acts and omissions to act in using the Game.  BNEA reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you.": "13.与其他使用条款之关系。本协议适用于所有在线服务、内容、游戏、产品，并可能结合更多针对游戏使用之条款。若本协议与针对游戏使用之条款文件有所矛盾冲突，以本协议为准（除非于针对游戏之使用条款另有说明）。",
  "14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n14.1. YOU AND BNEA AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.  THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (A) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND BNEA; (B) THIS EULA; OR (C) YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE GAME.  IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.\n14.2. However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or BNEA may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.\n14.3. This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from BNEA for you.\n14.4. An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court and provides more limited discovery.  It follows different rules than court proceedings and is subject to very limited review by courts.  The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND BNEA ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\n14.5. You and BNEA agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.  If you and BNEA do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or BNEA may commence an arbitration.  Written notice to BNEA must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Legal & Business Affairs Department, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc., 2051 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95054, USA. \n14.6. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section.  The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where applicable, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, both of which are available at http://www.adr.org.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this EULA. \n14.7. The AAA will administer the arbitration.  It may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the country/region where you live or at another mutually agreed location. \n14.8. If you seek $10,000 or less, BNEA agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  BNEA agrees not to seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.  If you seek more than $10,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and BNEA according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, if applicable. \n14.9. YOU AND BNEA AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA’s PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE.  THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.  You and BNEA also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this EULA and all other actions or arbitrations.\n14.10. If the agreement in this Section not to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action, or collective arbitration should be found illegal or unenforceable, you and BNEA agree that it shall not be severable, that this entire Section shall be unenforceable, and any claim or dispute would be resolved in court and not in collective arbitration. \n14.11. Notwithstanding this Section, you have the right to litigate any dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute, are satisfied. \n14.12. This Section shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.  If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of some or all of the provisions of this Section, notwithstanding Section 16 (Governing Law), such provisions will not apply to you.": "若您有任何关于本许可之疑问，请透过 https://www.bandainamcoent.eu/support，或BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment Asia Pte Ltd, 298 Tiong Bahru Road, Central Plaza ##11-01/02 Singapore 168730，联络BNE ASIA。",
